# FREELANCER â€“ "Place Where Skilled Meet Work"
FREELANCER is a fully responsive, visually appealing, and functionally rich web application built to connect service seekers (clients) with skilled professionals (freelancers). The platform enables users to interact in a structured environment where clients can post job requirements and freelancers can discover, apply for, and manage those opportunities seamlessly.

This project aims to simulate a real-world freelance marketplace like Fiverr or Upwork but with a focus on clean UI/UX, modern development practices, and a scalable architecture using cutting-edge front-end tools.
